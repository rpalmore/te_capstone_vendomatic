# te_capstone_vendomatic

I worked on this Tech Elevator project with fellow student Samuel Stauffer over the course of four days. We were tasked with writing a vending machine command-line application using standard I/O streams as part of our 14-week Java bootcamp. Tech Elevator provided some starting code, including a .csv file of the machine's stock.

This capstone marked the end of our first module. You can learn more about Tech Elevator's coding bootcamps here: https://www.techelevator.com/.

A big thanks to my coding partner Sam and the awesome instructors Margaret Green, Gregor Dzierzon, Andy Chong Sam and Joshua Mack for their support.
